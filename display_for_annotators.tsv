obo id / shorthand	label	RO/GOREL ID	subsets	Checked by RH	Comments
activated_by	activated_by	GOREL:0000507	chemical, display_for_curators, valid_for_extension	Y	N.B. display_for_curators means the relation will appear in the QG visualisation graph (ontology editors need to check those that need to appear to give graph structure), valid_for_extension means the relation will appear in P2GO drop-down
acts_on_population_of	acts_on_population_of	GOREL:0001006	cell_or_anatomical, display_for_curators, valid_for_extension, GO:cellular_component	Y	
adjacent_to	adjacent to	RO:0002220	GO:cellular_component, cell_or_anatomical, display_for_curators 	Y	Remove from display_for_curators subset. Local domain and range needs to be specified.
causally_upstream_of	causally upstream of	RO:0002411	GO:biological_process, GO:molecular_function, display_for_curators, valid_for_extension	Y	
coincident_with	coincident with	RO:0002008	GO:cellular_component, display_for_curators, ro-eco	Y	Remove from display_for_curators subset
dependent_on	dependent_on	GOREL:0000004	GO:biological_process, GO:molecular_function, chemical, display_for_curators, sequence_feature, sequence_or_complex, valid_for_extension	Y	Need to decide if this is being kept (and children such as localization_dependent_on)
exists_during	exists_during	GOREL:0000032	GO:biological_process, developmental_stages, display_for_curators, valid_for_extension	Y	
happens_during	happens during	GOREL:0000001	GO:biological_process, developmental_stages, display_for_curators, ro-eco, valid_for_extension	Y	
has_agent	has active participant	RO:0002218	GO:cellular_component, cell_or_anatomical, display_for_curators, ro-eco, valid_for_extension	Y	Need to set local domain to GO:biological process
has_direct_input	has_direct_input	GOREL:0000752	chemical, display_for_curators, sequence_or_complex, valid_for_extension	Y	
has_input	has input	RO:0002233	chemical, display_for_curators, ro-eco, sequence_or_complex, valid_for_extension	Y	Consider removing GO:0051716 Cellular response to stimulus from local range - should use part_of for response to
has_output	has output	RO:0002234	chemical, display_for_curators, ro-eco, sequence_or_complex, valid_for_extension	Y	
has_participant	has participant	RO:0000057	display_for_curators, not_for_annotation_extension	Y	Shouldn't need local domain and range if not used in extensions
has_regulation_target	has_regulation_target	GOREL:0000015	display_for_curators, sequence_or_complex, valid_for_extension	Y	
in_presence_of	in_presence_of	GOREL:0000027	chemical, display_for_curators, sequence_or_complex, valid_for_extension	Y	Need to decide if this is being kept. If kept, consider removing CC from domain as this type of annotation should instead be captured as: gp that would have been in the range should be annotated to a 'protein localization' term and transports_or_maintains_localization_of X in the extension.
inhibited_by	inhibited_by	GOREL:0000508	chemical, display_for_curators, valid_for_extension	Y	
occurs_at	occurs at	GOREL:0000501	GO:cellular_component, display_for_curators, sequence_feature, valid_for_extension	Y	
occurs_in	occurs in		GO:cellular_component, cell_or_anatomical, display_for_curators, valid_for_extension	Y	
part_of	part of		GO:biological_process, GO:cellular_component, cell_or_anatomical, developmental_stages, display_for_curators, valid_for_annotation,  valid_for_extension	Y	Has valid_for_annotation subset, which is not used anywhere else.
regulates_activity_of	regulates activity of	GOREL:0098702	display_for_curators, sequence_or_complex, valid_for_extension	Y	
regulates_expression_of	regulates expression of	GOREL:0098789	display_for_curators, sequence_feature, valid_for_extension	Y	Need a local domain and range. Why is the domain BFO:0000015? Most of the others are BFO:0000007 which we have been interpreting as MF or BP.

regulates_o_has_participant	regulates_o_has_participant	GOREL:0001016	display_for_curators, not_for_annotation_extension	Y	Has been used by MGI, but probably should not be used as we don't use has_participant itself
