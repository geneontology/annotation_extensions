obo id / shorthand	label	RO/GOREL ID	subsets	Checked by RH	Comments	Implementation notes
ctivated_by	activated_by	GOREL:0000507	AE_chemical, display_for_curators	Y	N.B. display_for_curators means the relation will appear in the QG visualisation graph (ontology editors need to check those that need to appear to give graph structure), valid_for_extension means the relation will appear in P2GO drop-down	
acts_on_population_of	acts_on_population_of	GOREL:0001006	AE_cell_or_anatomical, display_for_curators	Y		
adjacent_to	adjacent to	RO:0002220	AE_cell_or_anatomical, AE_cellular_component, display_for_curators	Y	Remove from display_for_curators subset. Local domain and range needs to be specified.	Are you sure?
causally_upstream_of	causally upstream of	RO:0002411	AE_biological_process, AE_molecular_function, display_for_curators	Y		
coincident_with	coincident with	RO:0002008	AE_cellular_component, display_for_curators, ro-eco	Y	Remove from display_for_curators subset	Recently requested by Midori,  It should stay and be better documented
dependent_on	dependent_on	GOREL:0000004	AE_biological_process, AE_chemical, AE_molecular_function, AE_sequence_feature, AE_sequence_or_complex, display_for_curators	Y	Need to decide if this is being kept (and children such as localization_dependent_on)	Postposing pending further discussion

has_agent	has active participant	RO:0002218	AE_cell_or_anatomical, AE_cellular_component, display_for_curators, ro-eco	Y	DONE Need to set local domain to GO:biological process	
has_direct_input	has_direct_input	GOREL:0000752	AE_chemical, AE_sequence_or_complex, display_for_curators	Y		
has_input	has input	RO:0002233	AE_chemical, AE_sequence_or_complex, display_for_curators, ro-eco	Y	DONE Consider removing GO:0051716 Cellular response to stimulus from local range - should use part_of for response to	Removed.  Should have been => Jenkins error due to OWL range
has_output	has output	RO:0002234	AE_chemical, AE_sequence_or_complex, display_for_curators, ro-eco	Y		
has_participant	has participant	RO:0000057	display_for_curators	Y	Shouldn't need local domain and range if not used in extensions	Some concern that you may want to allow use in future, so keeping these.

in_presence_of	in_presence_of	GOREL:0000027	AE_chemical, AE_sequence_or_complex, display_for_curators	Y	Need to decide if this is being kept. If kept, consider removing CC from domain as this type of annotation should instead be captured as: gp that would have been in the range should be annotated to a 'protein localization' term and transports_or_maintains_localization_of X in the extension.	Postposing pending further discussion

regulates_expression_of	regulates expression of	GOREL:0098789	AE_sequence_feature, display_for_curators	Y	Need a local domain and range. Why is the domain BFO:0000015? Most of the others are BFO:0000007 which we have been interpreting as MF or BP.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000007 is not a valid BFO ID.  http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000015 is what you need.

regulates_o_has_participant	regulates_o_has_participant	GOREL:0001016	display_for_curators	Y	Has been used by MGI, but probably should not be used as we don't use has_participant itself	Worth keeping for grouping - or merging with has_regulation_target
