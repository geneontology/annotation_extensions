* [Annotation extension relation usage reports](annotation_extension_usage_reports/)
* Code used to generate documention & usage reports for annotators
* [Documentation of of the annotation extension pipeline, dependencies and validation](https://github.com/geneontology/annotation_extensions/wiki)
* [Tickets](https://github.com/geneontology/annotation_extensions/issues) requesting changes to the annotation extension relations and all related coded and documentation.

## Dynamically generated documentation of annotation extension relations

In an ideal world, everyone would be using a single system for editing and viewing all AE extension relation content. Protege is ideal for this, but annotators have traditionally relied on a manually maintained [wiki](http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Annotation_usage_examples_for_each_annotation_extension_relation).  This inevitably goes stale, and so we have moved these pages to this repository ([doc](doc/)), where generation of their ontology-derived content is automated -  pulling information from the OWL file.  These pages retain a manual component consisting of examples of usage & how extended annotations are ['folded'](http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Folding_and_Unfolding) into the ontology.
