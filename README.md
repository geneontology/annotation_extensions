## Dynamically generated documentation of annotation extension relations

In an ideal world, everyone would be using a single system for editing and viewing all AE extension relation content. It's probably asking too much for that one place to be Protege, although we should pull as much as we can into the OWL file itself.  Work is ongoing to move the manually maintained [wiki](http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Annotation_usage_examples_for_each_annotation_extension_relation) to a set of semi-automated pages, pulling information from the OWL file.  The latest versions of these pages can be viewed in the [/doc](doc) folder on this repository.
