[]

### Definition
The relationship that links an entity with the process that results in the formation and shaping of that entity over time from an immature to a mature state.

### Usage
The relationship that links an entity with the process that results in the formation and shaping of that entity over time from an immature to a mature state.

### Comment
Example of use: an annotation of gene X to cell morphogenesis with results_in_morphogenesis_of CL:0000540 (neuron) means that at the end of the process an input neuron has attained its shape.

'''1. A protein's involvement in changing a particular cell's shape:'''

Statement from paper:

''Eotaxin, eotaxin-2, and MCP-4 were the most potent inducers of eosinophil shape change, followed by MCP-3, while MCP-1 and IL-8 were inactive. MCP-4 alone showed a bell-shaped eosinophil dose-response curve over the dose range tested. Eotaxin and eotaxin-2 were inactive on monocytes (Fig. 2â‡“B), whereas MCP-1, -3, and -4 all induced monocyte shape change, with MCP-3 exhibiting the highest potency.''

Note the use of the pipe to create a multiple annotation extensions. The interpretation of this annotation is MCP4 is involved in the regulation of eosinophil cell shape and monocyte cell shape.
