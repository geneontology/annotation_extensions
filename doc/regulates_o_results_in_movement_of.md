* OWL ID: GOREL_0001005
* label: regulates process that results in movement of
* synonyms
[u'regulates_o_results_in_movement_of']

### Definition
A relation that holds between a process that regulates locomotion and the cell or organism whose locomotion is being regulated.

### Usage
Use this relation to relate a process that regulates locomotion to the cell or organism whose locomotion is being regulated.

### Comment
This is the combination of the regulates relation with the results_in_movement_of relation.  Example of use: an annotation of gene X to 'regulation of cell migration with 'regulates_o_results_in_movement_of(CL:0000653) in column 16 would mean that gene X is involved in the regulation of glomerular visceral epithelial cell migration.
