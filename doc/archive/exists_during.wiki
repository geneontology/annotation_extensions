==Definition==

Identifies a process or stage during which a cellular component is present.

==Child terms==

* None.

==Scope of use==

===Domain===

BFO:0000004 ! independent continuant (Cellular Component)

===Range===

GO:0008150 ! Biological Process,  WBls:0000075 ! nematode life stage, ZFS:0100000 ! Zebrafish stage

==Annotation Extension Usage Examples==

=== Enhancing Cell Component Annotations ===

Cellular component annotations can be enhanced by specifying that localization is observed during a cell cycle or developmental stage, or in the context of a specific biological process. 

1. If a gene product is localized to the nuclear periphery in S phase, G2, and mitosis (S. pombe Ulp1; PMID:11884512):

  col 5: GO:0034399 ! nuclear periphery
  col 16: exists_during(GO:0000084)|exists_during(GO:0000085)|exists_during(GO:0007067) ! S phase of mitotic cell cycle,
  G2 phase of mitotic cell cycle, and mitosis respectively

2. If a gene product is localized to the spindle pole body (SPB) and nucleolus in interphase and to the actin contractile ring, the mitotic spindle, and kinetochores during mitosis (S. pombe Clp1; PMID:16085490):

  col 5: GO:0005816 ! spindle pole body
  col 16: exists_during(GO:0051329) ! interphase of mitotic cell cycle

  col 5: GO:0005730 ! nucleolus
  col 16: exists_during(GO:0051329) ! interphase of mitotic cell cycle

  col5: GO:0005826 ! actomyosin contractile ring
  col 16: exists_during(GO:0007067) ! mitosis

  col5: GO:0000777 ! condensed chromosome kinetochore
  col 16: exists_during(GO:0007067) ! mitosis

Note that an experiment that supports 'CC exists_during BP' may also support an annotation of the [[Annotation_Cross_Products#Specifying_the_location_in_which_a_process_happens|'BP occurs_in CC']] pattern.
