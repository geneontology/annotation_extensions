==Definition==

The relationship that links a specified entity with the process that results in an unspecified entity acquiring the features and characteristics of the specified entity.

==Child terms==

* None.

==Scope of use==

===Domain===

BFO:0000007 ! process (Biological Process or Molecular Function)

===Range===

[[ENTITY_UNION:0000006]] ! entity

==Annotation Extension Usage Examples==

=== Enhancing Molecular Function and Biological Process Annotations ===

==== Specifying the cell or tissue type which acquires new features following a specific process or function ====

'''1. Differentiation of a particular cell type:'''

Statement from paper:

''REN promoted neuronal differentiation of neural committed progenitor cells of CNS (ST14A cells, Fig. 7 A) or PNS (N2a cells, Fig. 7 B) origin.''

'''2. A protein's involvement in changing a particular cell's shape:'''

Statement from paper:

''Eotaxin, eotaxin-2, and MCP-4 were the most potent inducers of eosinophil shape change, followed by MCP-3, while MCP-1 and IL-8 were inactive. MCP-4 alone showed a bell-shaped eosinophil dose-response curve over the dose range tested. Eotaxin and eotaxin-2 were inactive on monocytes (Fig. 2â‡“B), whereas MCP-1, -3, and -4 all induced monocyte shape change, with MCP-3 exhibiting the highest potency.''

Note the use of the pipe to create a multiple annotation extensions. The interpretation of this annotation is MCP4 is involved in the regulation of eosinophil cell shape and monocyte cell shape.
