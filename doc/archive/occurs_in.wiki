==Definition==

Identifies the cell, tissue, cellular component or anatomical entity in which the molecular function or biological process occurs.

==Child terms==

* None.

==Scope of use==

===Domain===

BFO:0000007 ! process (Biological Process or Molecular Function)

===Range===

[[ENTITY_UNION:0000006]] ! entity

==Annotation Extension Usage Examples==

=== Enhancing Molecular Function and Biological Process Annotations ===

==== Specifying the cell or tissue type in which a process happens ====

'''1. Differentiation of a particular cell type:'''

Statement from paper:

''REN promoted neuronal differentiation of neural committed progenitor cells of CNS (ST14A cells, Fig. 7 A) or PNS (N2a cells, Fig. 7 B) origin.''


More examples of this usage of occurs_in can be found on the documentation page for [[Column_16:_Cell_Type]]

==== Specifying the subcellular location in which a process happens ====

1. '''Protein interaction in a particular location in the cell:'''

Statement from paper:

''Canine cardiac junctional SR vesicles were solubilized with 2% Triton X-100 and loaded on the affinity column equilibrated in EGTA-containing buffer (Fig.1). Calsequestrin-binding proteins were then eluted in buffer containing 20 mm CaCl2, a calcium concentration sufficient to disrupt all calsequestrin protein-binding interactions. Immunoblotting of the eluted fractions with triadin antibody revealed that triadin bound completely to the column and was eluted as a discrete peak in Ca2+-containing buffer (Fig. 1 A, upper)''

2. '''Sequestering of calcium ion at a particular location in the cell:'''

Statement from paper:  

''To characterize the effects of the new CASQ2 mutations on SR Ca2+ handling in vivo, we performed experiments in adult rat ventricular myocytes infected with adenoviral constructs. Caffeine (10 mmol/L) was applied to myocytes expressing either WT or mutant CASQ2 to evaluate the SR Ca2+-storing capacity by measurement of fluo-3 fluorescence and of Na+/Ca2+ exchange current (INCX; Figure 4A; Table 1).21 Expression of WT increased the SR Ca2+ content by 50%, whereas CASQ2 G112+5X reduced the SR content, not only as compared with WT expression but also as compared with native cells (Ad-control).''

|}

Note the use of the comma to create a compound annotation extension. The interpretation of this annotation is CASQ2 is involved in sequestering calcium ions in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of cardiac muscle cell.

'''2. A protein's involvement in changing a particular cell's shape:'''
