==Definition==

Identifies an entity affected (bound, transported, modified, consumed or destroyed) by the gene product's participation in a molecular function or biological process.

==Comment==

[http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Annotation_Extension_Relation:has_participant#Comment '''More details on the limited use of has_input with biological process annotations''']

'''If you know that the target is bound by the annotated gene product then consider using this child relationship'''

* [[Annotation_Extension_Relation:has_direct_input|has_direct_input]]

For ''Molecular Function'' GO terms such as [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GTerm?id=GO:0004175 endopeptidase activity] use the relationship [http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Annotation_Extension_Relation:has_direct_input 'has_direct_input'] <span style="color:red">substrate</span> (possibly has_substrate if this relationship is made available). The substrate included in the annotation extension should be known to bind the protein annotated. 

The endopeptidase, in the example above, would also have the ''Biological Process'' GO term annotation (eg [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GTerm?id=GO:0006508 proteolysis] with the annotation extension relationship 'has_input' <span style="color:red">substrate</span>.

For ''Molecular Function'' GO terms such as endopeptidase inhibitor activity use the relationship [http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Annotation_Extension_Relation:has_direct_input 'has_direct_input'] <span style="color:red">endopeptidase</span>, the protein included in the annotation extension should be known to bind the annotated inhibitor. 


'''If the annotation associated with the gene product is a regulation of ''Biological Process'' then consider using the child relationship'''

* [http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Annotation_Extension_Relation:has_regulation_target 'has_regulation_target']<span style="color:red">target of biological process</span>

eg: [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GTerm?id=GO:0045861 negative regulation of proteolysis] with the annotation extension relationship [http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Annotation_Extension_Relation:has_regulation_target 'has_regulation_target']  <span style="color:red">target of proteolysis</span>, with the substrate of the endopeptidase that is regulated by the inhibitor included in the annotation extension field


'''If the annotation associated with the gene product is a regulation of ''Molecular Function'' (eg if the gene product is an enzyme regulator) then consider using the child relationship'''

* [http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Annotation_Extension_Relation:has_input 'has_input']  <span style="color:red">endopeptidase</span>

eg: [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GTerm?id=GO:0010951 negative regulation of endopeptidase activity], with the annotation relationship [http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Annotation_Extension_Relation:has_input 'has_input']  <span style="color:red">endopeptidase</span>, the endopeptidase that is inhibited by (in this case) the endopeptidase inhibitor is included in the annotation extension field

<span style="color:blue">Therefore the endopeptidase inhibitor would have two ''Biological Process'' GO term annotations and one ''Molecular Function'' annotation eg:</span>

* [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GTerm?id=GO:0045861 negative regulation of proteolysis] with the annotation extension relationship [http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Annotation_Extension_Relation:has_regulation_target 'has_regulation_target']  <span style="color:red">substrate</span>, with the substrate of the inhibited endopeptidase included in the annotation extension field
* [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GTerm?id=GO:0010951 negative regulation of endopeptidase activity], with the annotation relationship [http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Annotation_Extension_Relation:has_input 'has_input']  <span style="color:red">endopeptidase</span>, with the endopeptidase that is inhibited in the annotation extension field
* [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GTerm?id=GO:0004866 endopeptidase inhibitor activity], with the annotation relationship [http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Annotation_Extension_Relation:has_direct_input 'has_direct_input'] <span style="color:red">endopeptidase</span>, with the endopeptidase included in the annotation extension known to bind the annotated inhibitor.

==Synonyms==

has_target (EXACT)

localizes (NARROW)

==Child terms==

If you know that the target is bound by the annotated gene product then consider using this child relationship

* [[Annotation_Extension_Relation:has_direct_input|has_direct_input]]

==Scope of use==

===Domain===

BFO:0000007 ! process (Biological Process or Molecular Function) 

===Range===

[[ENTITY_UNION:0000005]] ! chemical, gene product, or complex


==Annotation Extension Usage Examples==

=== Enhancing Molecular Function and Biological Process Annotations ===

==== Specifying the chemical that was applied and induced a 'response to chemicals' ====

GOC policy is not to use the annotation extension field to capture the input to the process (eg a chemical/protein), instead new GO terms are requested (using Term Genie).


'''Cellular response to drug'''

Statement from paper: ''incubation of cells with low concentrations of phenformin and depletion of Ppm1E increased AMPK phosphorylation''

So one of the annotations would be:


{| class="wikitable" border="1"

!Object (Col 3)
!GO ID (Col 5)
!Reference (Col 6)
!Evidence (Col 7)

|IDA
|has_input(CHEBI:6801 <span style="color:green">metformin</span>)
|-
|}

==== Specifying the protein which is a target of a Biological Process ====



'''Proteolysis targets''' 

Statement from paper: 
''MICA shedding by tumor cells was inhibited by silencing of the related ADAM10 and ADAM17 proteases''.

'''No direct binding of MICA to ADAM10 and ADAM17 was shown therefore the relationship 'has_direct_input' was not applied.'''

So one of the annotations would be:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
!DB (Col 2)
!Object (Col 3)
!GO ID (Col 5)
!Reference (Col 6)
!Evidence (Col 7)

==== Specifying the protein which is a target of a Biological Process ====

No new term will be created in this example because this is outside of the scope of GO, although tools using GO could use the relationship to create the following:
