!INCLUDE

==Comment==

This relation should not be used to annotate one gene product regulating another's activity; a regulator Molecular Function or regulation Biological Process should be used in such cases.

== Annotation Extension Usage Examples ==

=== Specifying that a gene product is activated by a specific chemical ===

1. zinc activated ligand-gated ion channel (ZACN) is activated by Zn2+, PMID:12381728

So the annotation would be:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
!DB (Col 2)
!Object (Col 3)
!GO ID (Col 5)
!Reference (Col 6)
!Extension (Col 16)
|-
|Q401N2 
|ZACN 
|GO:0048471 
|PMID:12381728 
|activated_by (ChEBI:29105, zinc ions)
|-
|}

== Using examples to demonstrate [[Folding_and_Unfolding]] using the relationship activated_by ==

1. zinc activated ligand-gated ion channel (ZACN) is activated by Zn2+, PMID:12381728

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
! Folded/unfolded
!DB (Col 2)
!Object (Col 3)
!GO ID (Col 5)
!Reference (Col 6)
!Extension (Col 16)
