==Definition==

The relationship that links an entity with the process that results in the formation and shaping of that entity over time from an immature to a mature state.

Identifies the cell, tissue, or anatomical entity which are under going the morphogenic process.

==Child terms==

* None.

==Scope of use==

===Domain===

BFO:0000007 ! process (Biological Process or Molecular Function)

===Range===

[[ENTITY_UNION:0000006]] ! entity

'''1. A protein's involvement in changing a particular cell's shape:'''

Statement from paper:

''Eotaxin, eotaxin-2, and MCP-4 were the most potent inducers of eosinophil shape change, followed by MCP-3, while MCP-1 and IL-8 were inactive. MCP-4 alone showed a bell-shaped eosinophil dose-response curve over the dose range tested. Eotaxin and eotaxin-2 were inactive on monocytes (Fig. 2â‡“B), whereas MCP-1, -3, and -4 all induced monocyte shape change, with MCP-3 exhibiting the highest potency.''

Note the use of the pipe to create a multiple annotation extensions. The interpretation of this annotation is MCP4 is involved in the regulation of eosinophil cell shape and monocyte cell shape. 

More examples of this usage of occurs_in can be found on the documentation page for [[Column_16:_Cell_Type]]
