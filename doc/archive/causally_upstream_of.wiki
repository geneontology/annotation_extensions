'''1. Specifying the biological process upstream of the regulation of mRNA expression levels.'''

Summary of paper, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11875061 PMID:11875061]: 

''Transfection of mouse Foxa2 into rat INS-r3 cells results in blunted glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and drastically decreased mRNA levels of insulin, GLUT2 and glucokinase. In contrast, loss of Foxa2 function leads to up-regulation of hexokinase (HK) I and II and glucokinase (HK-IV) mRNA expression and down-regulation of KATP Channel Subunits Sur1 and Kir6.2 mRNA expression. High levels of the glucose transporter Glut2, enable rapid equilibration of glucose across the plasma membrane, whereas low levels of high affinity hexokinase isoforms (hexokinases I, II, and III) optimize glucose sensing in the physiological blood glucose range. Glucokinase (hexokinase IV) is rate-limiting enzyme for glucose metabolism, and determines the glucose sensing in pancreatic β-cells.''

'''2. Specifying the biological process downstream of regulation of protein levels.'''

Summary of paper, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553947 PMID:24553947]: 

''Loss of PINK1 in PINK1-/- knockout mice decreased HIF-1alpha translation, thus resulting in a lower HIF-1alpha level. PINK-/- mice exhibited significantly reduced induction of HIF-1aplha protein, HIF-1alpha transcriptional activity, and hypoxia-responsive gene up regulation''

Background, and paper in more detail

''HIF-alpha is a transcription factor that under hypoxia binds to hypooxia-response elements (HREs) in the promoter, and up regulates HRE-containing genes that govern a multitude of cellular functions.  In PMID 24553947, the inductions of three HRE genes (GLUT-1, BNIP3 and VEGFalpha) were examined. BNIP3 and VEGFalpha mRNA increased more dramatically in PINK+/+ than PINK -/- primary neurons treated with 1%O2. And PINK+/+ MEFs had significantly higher levels of GLUT-1 and BNIP3 mRNA. Luciferase assays demonstrate reduced HIF-1alpha activity in PINK1-/- knockout MEFs''
