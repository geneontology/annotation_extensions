'''Loss of transcription factor activity affects gene expression:'''

Statements from paper:  

''Indeed, LGG-1 was massively upregulated in atf-2(tm467) mutant embryos, as compared with the wild type (Fig. 6A). We observed a similar extent of BEC-1 upregulation in the atf-2-deficient background (data not shown).''
