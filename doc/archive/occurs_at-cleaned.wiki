'''Specifying the sequence feature at which chromatin silencing occurs:'''

Statement from paper:  

''Mutation of hip3+ alleviates transcriptional silencing at several heterochromatic loci, including in the outer (otr) centromeric repeats, indicating that Hip3 is required for the integrity of pericentric heterochromatin...deletion of hip3+ in this background resulted in the formation of light pink colonies, demonstrating that transcriptional silencing in the otr centromeric repeats is reduced, indicating that Hip3 is required for the integrity of pericentric heterochromatin (Fig. 7A).''

'''Endocytosis in S. pombe occurs at the cell division site:'''

Statement from paper:  

''We also investigated the relationship of equatorial endocytosis to the exocyst, a complex of proteins associated with exocytosis that has a specific role in cytokinesis in fission yeast (Wang et al., 2002)...We therefore added FM4-64 to sec8-1 labelled with DAPI and scored the percentage of cells showing FM4-64 fluorescence between the dividing nuclei at both the permissive and restrictive temperatures. Equatorial endocytosis was inhibited in this mutant (Fig. 8A), although endocytosis at the cell poles was apparently normal (data not shown)... Thus, endocytosis at the division plane may serve to balance exocytosis specifically at this site and at this stage of the cell cycle.''
