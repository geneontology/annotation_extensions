# Dependent_on has been used in 1800 annotations
It has been proposed that this relationship is depreciated
Suggestions need to be made to:
* 1. explain how to capture the current annotations to this term in GO AE field
* 2. document whether or not the information should be in GO at all

# Dependent_on, I have just extracted a selection of GOC annotations for examples 							
Many of these look like the extension information cannot be covered using the AE current relationships, and may be out of the scope of GO							
Considerable guidance is required in order to ensure edits follow consistent approach, ie improved documentation

## Pfam IDs							
SPOM	O60132	GO:0005515	protein binding	dependent_on(Pfam:PF00018) SH3 domain	IPI	PMID	24554432
this hasn't been annotated to SH3 domain binding, so presumably this means that the protein annotated needs to have the SH3 domain to bind the target, is it necessary to state this? Is the the reciprocal annotation to SH3 binding

is this suggesting that we list all proteins involved in a process in C16?
